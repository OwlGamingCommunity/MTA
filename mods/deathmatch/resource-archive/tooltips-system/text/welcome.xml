	<title>Welcome to the OwlGaming MTA roleplay server</title>
	<text>Before you begin we would like to introduce you to some key aspects of the server.
	
	The OwlGaming MTA server prides itself on innovation. In this server you will encounter many features which you would not have seen on any other GTA roleplay server. At various times while you are exploring the city the help icon will appear in the top right corner indicating that help text is available regarding a particular feature. Simply press m to enable the cursor and click the help icon to view the help text.
	
	Commands
	You can familiarise yourself with the available commands by typing /helpcmds. This will present you with a list of all the servers commands.
	
	Getting Help
	If at any point you require help you can use F1 to open a report. When an admin is available they will contact you to further assist with your problem. Please do not /pm admins directly for help. Along with F1, you can always ask for help from other players using /o (global OOC chat) and /b (local OOC chat).
